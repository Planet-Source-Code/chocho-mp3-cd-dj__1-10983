Program: This is an MP3 Player soon to be a CD Player as well.
	 That's why I call it "MP3-CD DJ."
	 I just want to get an idea of what people like and might
	 want before I go any further. So let me know what you think.

Installation: Put the MP3-CD DJ folder somewhere. Just make sure
	      you keep all of the files in the same directory or
	      you will have problems. A shortcut will be fine.


ETC: Send me any comments, questions, or concerns.
